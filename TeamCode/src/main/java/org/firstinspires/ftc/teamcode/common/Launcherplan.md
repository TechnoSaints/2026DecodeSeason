#Launcher Plan
## Propulsion
- Flywheel
  - Motor: 2x GoBilda Yellow Jacket 5203 series 6000 RPM
  - Configuration: Two motors mounted on either side of the launcher, using belts to synchronously drive the same axle.
  - Control: Built in velocity control will maintain the motors at a target velocity.

## Angle control
- Servo
  - Servo: Axon Max+
  - Configuration: Single servo mounted to a lever arm that adjusts the angle of the launcher.
  - Control: Using odometry and AprilTag calibration, the robot will automatically adjust the angle of the launcher based on a table of angles by distance.
